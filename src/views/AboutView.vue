        <h4>Reporting your findings</h4>
        <p>On the home screen, you are able to input the type of
            astrological sighting you have seen, as well as a text field
            to write any extra details such as date, time, instrument, magnification etc.
            The application immediately shows underneath any inputted text.
        </p>
        <h4>Observing your log</h4>
        <p>This page shows a log of all reported past asteroid sightings of Pallas, Ornamenta, Deborah, and Seeligeria.
            These recordings are fetched from the Asterank API. You can also input names of known asteroids into the
            diameter checker below, and the application will fetch and show you the diameter of that asteroid from the
            asterank API.
